Speed: (Time taken to encrypt and decrypt test *data)
- AES:    Average of -0.62 seconds
- RSA:    Average of 2.67 seconds
- Hybrid: Average of 2.34 seconds

Comparison:

AES - If you are working with BLE devices with low computationa power,
AES cryptography algorithm is best suited. Because it is faster and requires
low computation power to operate. Suitable for securing and transmision of data like messages.


RSA - If you are dealing with small quantity of data and end-to-end verification is of great importance, then RSA is recommended. Suitable for securing and transmision of data such as security key (small data).


Hybrid AES-RSA - If you need to secure and transmited messages but with additional layer of security for the decryption keys, the you can combine AES and RSA for the job. You can ecncrypt the message with AES keys the encrypt the AES with RSA. Now you have extrasecured keys using RSA and faster perfomance/large data handling capability of AES.


**The Hybrid mode tends to posses the higher computation time of the RSA algorithm.

Overal thoughts - AES is recommended with Bluetooth Low Energy applications.
